# A) How to setup
- Set your own values to the configuration variables in `hass_radarr_search_by_voice.py` and on your `hass_sonarr_search_by_voice.py`

```
HASS_SERVER="" # Home assistant URL eg. localhost:8123 with port
HASS_API="" # Home assistant legacy api password, leave blank if using long-lived token (used for voice feedback)
HASS_TOKEN="" # Home assistant long-lived token, leave blank if using legacy API (used for voice feedback)
HASS_SCRIPTS_PATH="" # Home assistant scripts path eg. /users/vr/.homeassistant/scripts or for container (e.g HA SUPERVISED) /config/scripts
HASS_GOOGLE_HOME_ENTITY="" # Home assistant google home entity_id  eg. media_player.family_room_speaker
RADARR_SERVER="" # with port usually :7878
RADARR_API="" # api of radarr
RADARR_DOWNLOAD_PATH="" # aka rootFolderPath
RADARR_QUALITY_PROFILE_ID=4  # 1080p
TMDBID_API="" # themoviedb API Key
```
*Note to get HASS_TOKEN go to your home assistant (http://ip_of_server:8123/) then go to Your Profile (last option on the button at the left tab) then go to  Long-Lived Access Tokens at the end of the page.*

*Note to get the HASS_GOOGLE_HOME_ENTITY go to your home assistant (http://ip_of_server:8123/) then go to Your Configuration tab -> Entities , there is all entity ID of the devices in your home.*

# B) How to test from command line
Go to the path of the script, make sure the give executable permissions and run:
```python3 ./hass_radarr_search_by_voice.py "Artemis Fowl" "0"```

It should let you know if it found and added a movie (The Google Home Speaker, should speak back).

# C) Integrate with Home Assistant
1º Copy the content of the _example/homeassistant_ folder to your homeassistant folder. If you already have a custom yaml file for your own scripts and shell commands then just add the content of each files (_scripts.yaml_ and _shellcommand.yaml_) to your own files.

2º Let homeassistant know where your scripts and shell commands will be by adding the following lines to your _configuration.yaml_ (in case you are using the same file structure as me).

```
script: !include scripts.yaml
shell_command: !include shellcommand.yaml
```

* Note DON'T needed if you are using the files from `/hass_radarr_search_by_voice/homeassistant_docker/`

3º In your _homeassistant/scripts/download.sh_.  file replace ‘/path/to/hass_radarr_search_by_voice.py’ with the actual path where you saved the python file.
  *IMPORTANT NOTE: If you follow the installation method you don't need to edit the path because it point to `/usr/share/hassio/homeassistant/hass_radarr_search_by_voice.py`*
 
 `downloads_tvshows.sh` <- for sonnar python script

      ```
      #!/bin/bash

      tvshow="$1"
      mode="$2"

      response=$(python3 /YOUR_PATH/hass_sonarr_search_by_voice.py "$tvshow" "$mode")
      ```

`downloads.sh`

    ```
    #!/bin/bash

    movie="$1"
    mode="$2"

    response=$(python3 /YOUR_PATH/hass_radarr_search_by_voice.py "$movie" "$mode")
    ```

4º Fill up the User defined variables in your _hass_radarr_search_by_voice.py_

5º Make sure the give executable permissions to everything inside _homeassistant/scripts_ folder and to _hass_radarr_search_by_voice.py_ & _hass_sonarr_search_by_voice.py_ file.
